# Viriciti Assignment Exports

## Introduction

In order to be able to better assess my technical expertise, I was given a code challenge.

Hopefully the results will demonstrate that I am a qualified candidate.

### Assignment 

The assignment can be found on the Viriciti github under [Exports assignment](https://github.com/viriciti/exports-assignment).

The starting point was an example `unwind` utility and an `unwind_test` utility written in the [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org) programming language.

With the introduction of [ECMAScript 6](http://es6-features.org), CoffeeScript has become outdated and typed superset of JavaScript known as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) can easily replace many of its features.

Also, the example utility uses the [UnderscoreJS](https://underscorejs.org) and [Async](https://caolan.github.io/async/v3) libraries which can 

### Plan of attack

These are the steps that I took in order to tackle this challenging assignment:

* Brush up on MongoDB
* Learn Redis

## Requirements

You will have to have the following installed.

* docker
* angular
* node
* nestjs
* npm
* postgres
* mongodb
* redis


## Installation

From the command line execute the following.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kgish/viriciti-assignment-export.git
$ cd viriciti-assignment-export
$ chmod +x ./init-all.sh
$ ./init-all.sh
```

Verify that everything has been installed correctly by running the following tests.

```
```

## Directory structure

There are five sub-directories:

Convert Coffeescript to Typescript
Where possible replace async with promises.

## Redis

```
$ redis-commander --redis-port 6379 --redis-host localhost --redis-password viriciti
```
